# PATCHING OS IMAGE (PARENT DISK)

You potentially have following files somewhere:

- Win2022_G2.vhdx
- Win2022Core_G2.vhdx

To update latest Windows patches for those images, proceed this way:
- .\DownloadLatestCUs.ps1
  - this will download latest cumulative updates
  - you potentially want to collect all MSU packages under same folder structure
  - note: this does not download EVERYTHING - you might need to download some additional msu files later
- .\PatchParentDisks.ps1
  - that will ask vhdx files (above)
  - and that will ask .msu files (patch information)
